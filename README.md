# Laravel10-PHP8v2-Dockerised
Followed along as part of a tutorial, created the docker-compose.yaml and nginx.dockerfile, php.dockerfile, composer dockerfile.
Built and ran nginx proxy for the PHP Interpreter using an nginx.conf file.
The PHP container interpreted the PHP requests sent to it by Nginx server (using the nginx.conf) and the mysql database with authentication, stored the data.
Also, as part of the course learnt to dockerise application-less containers utilising standalone composer, PHP Artisan, NPM.
Following on from the course upgraded to the latest PHP 8 and Laravel 10 and installed Laravel Breeze (utilising Vite and Tailwind CSS).
